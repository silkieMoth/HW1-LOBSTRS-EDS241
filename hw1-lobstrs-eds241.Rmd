#### DATA SOURCE:

Reed D. 2019. SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus), ongoing since 2012. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/a593a675d644fdefb736750b291579a0. Dataset accessed 11/17/2019.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Introduction**

You're about to dive into some deep data collected from five reef sites in Santa Barbara County, all about the abundance of California spiny lobsters! ðŸ¦ž Data was gathered by divers annually from 2012 to 2018 across Naples, Mohawk, Isla Vista, Carpinteria, and Arroyo Quemado reefs.

Why lobsters? Well, this sample provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) established on January 1, 2012 (Reed, 2019). Of these five reefs, Naples, and Isla Vista are MPAs, while the other three are not protected (non-MPAs). Comparing lobster health between these protected and non-protected areas gives us the chance to study how commercial and recreational fishing might impact these ecosystems.

We will consider the MPA sites the `treatment` group and use regression methods to explore whether protecting these reefs really makes a difference compared to non-MPA sites (our control group). In this assignment, weâ€™ll think deeply about which causal inference assumptions hold up under the research design and identify where they fall short. 

Letâ€™s break it down step by step and see what the data reveals! ðŸ“Š

![](figures/map-5reefs.png)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Anticipating potential sources of selection bias

**a.** Do the control sites (Arroyo Quemado, Carpenteria, and Mohawk) provide a strong counterfactual for our treatment sites (Naples, Isla Vista)? Write a paragraph making a case for why this comparison is centris paribus or whether selection bias is likely (be specific!).  

It's potentially impossible to create an 'all other things equal' study in a field setting, because there are so many stochastic factors. Some degree of selection bias is likely always present in field studies, as you are selecting a transect to represent an entire ecosystem. But environmental conditions are heterogeneous and each transect could have it's own unique qualities. In this case, differences such as local human activity, development, slope/elevation of nearby land, unforeseen historical factors, etc, could skew the data. That being said, we can at least set up a study that's close enough to centris paribus for the results to be meaningful. Here, all sites are located in the same general ecological zone, and they are all south facing. They may not be the same size, but this can be acknowledged and accounted for.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Read & wrangle data

**a.** Read in the raw data. Name the data.frame (`df`) `rawdata`

**b.** Use the function `clean_names()` from the `janitor` package

```{r}
# HINT: check for coding of missing values (`na = "-99999"`)

rawdata <- read_csv(here('data', 'lobster_sbchannel_24.csv')) %>% 
    clean_names() %>% 
    mutate(size_mm = na_if(size_mm, -99999))
```

**c.** Create a new `df` named `tidydata`. Using the variable `site` (reef location) create a new variable `reef` as a `factor` and add the following labels in the order listed (i.e., re-order the `levels`): 
    
    "Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", "Isla Vista",  "Naples"

```{r}

tidydata <- rawdata %>%
    mutate(reef = factor(site, 
                         levels = c("AQUE", "CARP", "MOHK", "IVEE", "NAPL"), 
                         labels = c("Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", "Isla Vista",  "Naples")))
    
```

Create new `df` named `spiny_counts` 

**d.** Create a new variable `counts` to allow for an analysis of lobster counts where the unit-level of observation is the total number of observed lobsters per `site`, `year` and `transect`. 

- Create a variable `mean_size` from the variable `size_mm`
- NOTE: The variable `counts` should have values which are integers (whole numbers). 
- Make sure to account for missing cases (`na`)!

**e.** Create a new variable `mpa` with levels `MPA` and `non_MPA`. For our regression analysis create a numerical variable `treat` where MPA sites are coded `1` and non_MPA sites are coded `0`

```{r}
#HINT(d): Use `group_by()` & `summarize()` to provide the total number of lobsters observed at each site-year-transect row-observation. 

#HINT(e): Use `case_when()` to create the 3 new variable columns

spiny_counts <- tidydata %>%
    mutate(mpa = case_when(
                  site %in% c("AQUE", "CARP", "MOHK") ~ 'MPA',
                  site %in% c("IVEE", "NAPL") ~ 'non_MPA'
              ), 
              treat = case_when(
                  mpa == 'MPA' ~ 1,
                  mpa == 'non_MPA' ~ 0)) %>%
    group_by(site, year, transect) %>%
    reframe(counts = n(), 
            mean_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE), 
            mpa = first(mpa),
            treat = first(treat))
```

> NOTE: This step is crucial to the analysis. Check with a friend or come to TA/instructor office hours to make sure the counts are coded correctly!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Explore & visualize data

**a.** Take a look at the data! Get familiar with the data in each `df` format (`tidydata`, `spiny_counts`)

**b.** We will focus on the variables `count`, `year`, `site`, and `treat`(`mpa`) to model lobster abundance. Create the following 4 plots using a different method each time from the 6 options provided. Add a layer (`geom`) to each of the plots including informative descriptive statistics (you choose; e.g., mean, median, SD, quartiles, range). Make sure each plot dimension is clearly labeled (e.g., axes, groups).

- [Density plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/density-plot-group-ggplot2)
- [Ridge plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/ggridges/)
- [Jitter plot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html) 
- [Violin plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/violin-plot-group-ggplot2) 
- [Histogram](https://r-charts.com/distribution/histogram-density-ggplot2/) 
- [Beeswarm](https://r-charts.com/distribution/beeswarm/)

Create plots displaying the distribution of lobster **counts**:

1) grouped by reef site  
2) grouped by MPA status
3) grouped by year

Create a plot of lobster **size** :

4) You choose the grouping variable(s)!

                       values = viridisLite::turbo(5))
    
```

**c.** Compare means of the outcome by treatment group. Using the `tbl_summary()` function from the package [`gt_summary`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html) 

```{r}
# USE: gt_summary::tbl_summary()
tbl_summary(spiny_counts, treat)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: OLS regression- building intuition

**a.** Start with a simple OLS estimator of lobster counts regressed on treatment. Use the function `summ()` from the [`jtools`](https://jtools.jacob-long.com/) package to print the OLS output

**b.** Interpret the intercept & predictor coefficients *in your own words*. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the regression results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

This model would suggest that there is a extremely close relationship between treatment and count, as the R^2^ is approximately zero. This can be interpreted as there being an average difference of 6 in the lobster counts between the treatment sites and the non-treatment sites, with non-treatment sites having higher counts. Alternatively, it's possible that a linear model is just not appropriate to predict the relationship between these two variables.

```{r}
# NOTE: We will not evaluate/interpret model fit in this assignment (e.g., R-square)

m1_ols <- lm(counts ~ treat, spiny_counts)

summ(m1_ols, model.fit = FALSE) 
```

```{r}
summary(m1_ols)
```


```{r}
spiny_counts %>% 
    mutate(reg = fitted(m1_ols)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = treat, y = counts)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    geom_line(aes(x = treat, y = reg))

```

**c.** Check the model assumptions using the `check_model` function from the `performance` package

**d.** Explain the results of the 4 diagnostic plots. Why are we getting this result?

*   For the normality of residuals, when you run a linear regression for a model with a binary variable, you simply end up with points that have a very high residual, and some with coincidentally very low residuals because of the relationship between a binary variable and a straight line. This can be shown in both graphs, where there are specific regions in the data that are very far from the horizontal line, and some that are closer.
*   The homogeneity of variance graph suggests that the relationship is heteroscedastic, because points do not at all form a straight line. Likely because the relationship to the line is so strange, it appears that the assumption of equal variance between all points is not true.
*   The posterior predictive check graph assumes normal distribution of the data, which does not appear to be the case when you plot a linear model between counts and treatment. Because treatment is binary, all the data is bunched up around two points, 1 and 0. This can have strange results when attempting to plot a density graph.

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols,  check = "qq" )
```


```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "normality")
```


```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "homogeneity")
```


```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "pp_check")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Fitting GLMs

**a.** Estimate a Poisson regression model using the `glm()` function

**b.** Interpret the predictor coefficient in your own words. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

The poisson glm still shows a very close relationship between treatment and counts. It can be interpreted as the chance of a lobster count being from a treatment site or a non-treatment site being different by about 28%, with treatment sites being more likely to have less lobsters than the non-treatment sites.

**c.** Explain the statistical concept of dispersion and overdispersion in the context of this model. 

Dispersion is another word for variance. Overdispersion is when there is greater dispersion in the data than was expected to be the case based on the predictions of a model. For a poisson regression, there is an assumption that variance = mean, but this may not be true in the actual data, and variance > mean, which is overdispersion. In the case of this model, overdispersion could occur either from spatial autocoorelation between transects, or ommitted variable bias.

**d.** Compare results with previous model, explain change in the significance of the treatment effect

```{r}
#HINT1: Incidence Ratio Rate (IRR): Exponentiation of beta returns coefficient which is interpreted as the 'percent change' for a one unit increase in the predictor 

#HINT2: For the second glm() argument `family` use the following specification option `family = poisson(link = "log")`

m2_pois <- glm(counts ~ treat, family = poisson(link = 'log'), data = spiny_counts)

summary(m2_pois)

```

```{r}
summ(m2_pois)
```


```{r}
# getting mcfadden pseudo r2

loglik_glm <- logLik(m2_pois)
loglik_glm_null <- logLik(glm(counts ~ 1, family = poisson(link = 'log'), data = spiny_counts))

1 - (loglik_glm/loglik_glm_null)
```


```{r}
spiny_counts %>% 
    mutate(reg = fitted(m2_pois)) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = treat, y = counts)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    geom_line(aes(x = treat, y = reg))
```


**e.** Check the model assumptions. Explain results.

**f.** Conduct tests for over-dispersion & zero-inflation. Explain results.

```{r}
check_model(m2_pois)
```

```{r}
check_overdispersion(m2_pois)
```

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m2_pois)
```

**g.** Fit a negative binomial model using the function glm.nb() from the package `MASS` and check model diagnostics 

**h.** In 1-2 sentences explain rationale for fitting this GLM model.

**i.** Interpret the treatment estimate result in your own words. Compare with results from the previous model.

```{r}

# NOTE: The `glm.nb()` function does not require a `family` argument

m3_nb <- 

```


```{r}
check_overdispersion(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_predictions(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_model(m3_nb)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: Compare models 

**a.** Use the `export_summ()` function from the `jtools` package to look at the three regression models you fit side-by-side.

**c.** Write a short paragraph comparing the results. Is the treatment effect `robust` or stable across the model specifications. 

```{r}

export_summs(# ADD MODELS
             model.names = c("OLS","Poisson", "NB"),
             statistics = "none")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 7: Building intuition - fixed effects

**a.** Create  new `df` with the `year` variable converted to a factor

**b.** Run the following OLS model using `lm()`

- Use the following specification for the outcome `log(counts+1)`
- Estimate fixed effects for `year`
- Include an interaction term between variables `treat` and `year`

**c.** Take a look at the regression output. Each coefficient provides a comparison or the difference in means for a specific sub-group in the data. Informally, describe the what the model has estimated at a conceptual level (NOTE: you do not have to interpret coefficients individually)

**d.** Explain why the main effect for treatment is negative? *Does this result make sense?


```{r}

ff_counts <- spiny_counts %>% 
    mutate(year=as_factor(year))
    
m5_fixedeffs <- lm(
    log(counts+1) ~ treat*year,
    data = ff_counts)

summ(m5_fixedeffs, model.fit = FALSE)
```

**e.** Look at the model predictions: Use the `interact_plot()` function from package `interactions` to plot mean predictions by year and treatment status. 

**f.** Re-evaluate your responses (c) and (b) above. 

```{r}

# Hint 1: Group counts by `year` and `mpa` and calculate the `mean_count`
# Hint 2: Convert variable `year` to a factor

interact_plot(m5_fixedeffs, pred = year, modx = treat,
              outcome.scale = "response")

```

**g.** Using `ggplot()` create a plot in same style as the previous `interaction plot`, but displaying the original scale of the outcome variable (lobster counts). This type of plot is commonly used to show how the treatment effect changes across discrete time points (i.e., panel data).

The plot should have... 
- `year` on the x-axis
- `counts` on the y-axis
- `mpa` as the grouping variable


```{r}
# Hint 1: Group counts by `year` and `mpa` and calculate the `mean_count`
# Hint 2: Convert variable `year` to a factor

plot_counts <- 

# plot_counts %>% ggplot() ...
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 8: Reconsider causal identification assumptions

a. Discuss whether you think `spillover effects` are likely in this research context (see Glossary of terms; https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIudsVcYhWGpqC-Uftk9UTz3PIq6stVyEpT44EPNgpE/edit?usp=sharing)
b. Explain why spillover is an issue for the identification of causal effects
c. How does spillover relate to impact in this research setting?
d. Discuss the following causal inference assumptions in the context of the MPA treatment effect estimator. Evaluate if each of the assumption are reasonable: 
    
    1) SUTVA: Stable Unit Treatment Value assumption 
    2) Excludability assumption

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# EXTRA CREDIT

a. Create a new script for the analysis on the updated data
b. Run at least 3 regression models & assess model diagnostics
c. Compare and contrast results with the analysis from the 2012-2018 data sample (~ 2 paragraphs)
